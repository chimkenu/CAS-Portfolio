        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>A project sparked from passion and curiosity, this project aims to have an output of an album with (at least) 3 songs. This has been an ongoing project, as we have come up with 1 song already, and plan to finish on or before the end of March 2023. While this may be musical in nature, we will be using technology to create these songs, more specifically through the use of GarageBand and possibly other DAWs.</p>
        <p>In line with the SC thrust of bridging communities towards nurturing our shared home, the theme for this album is mood and humor. Inspired by Weird Al Yankovic, we aim to raise the spirits of listeners by creating comedic songs with varying genres. The 3 songs will be relatable and humorous in an attempt to help people through these difficult times.</p>
        <p>In our investigation, we contacted and surveyed some of our friends and batchmates to ask about music and the role it plays in their lives. We then asked about the impact our project could potentially have. Aside from interviewing our friends, we continued to survey more people - Xavier school students and others outside of our school. Our survey (of around 140 people, among which 69% are not from our batch) suggest that 68% would enjoy the theme of our album during hard and difficult days. Of those that responded, a majority (62%) said that they would greatly benefit from this project. With this, it can be said that there is great demand for uplifting music - and with this large amount of survey responses, it is safe to say that there will be a positive impact on the lives of others, even for those outside of our friend groups and batch. Our role in this project aims to provide for this demand.</p>
        <p>Besides our data, studies online have showed that music can have multiple benefits on the mental health of people. In an article by Healthline (2020), music can help benefit learning and memory. It can also alleviate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and mental illness. Another source which has been medically reviewed by Daniel B. Block, MD (2022) stated that "Music can be a source of pleasure and contentment... Music can relax the mind, energize the body, and even help people better manage pain."</p>
        <p>With this investigation and the results of our survey, we can extrapolate to say that we could be able to benefit a larger group of people - more specifically those from our generation, through the creation of the album as it can be used as a form of stress relief and source of inspiration to get through the day.</p>
        <p>From this project, we will hopefully challenge ourselves and learn the different styles and genres of music as well as the skills needed in the process of writing, composing, recording, and mixing music. In addition to this, we expect to learn commitment and perseverance throughout this relatively long project, and be able to collaborate and communicate effectively amongst the group.</p>
