        <h2>Experience - Exercise Routine</h2>
        <h3>Part 1: <a href="https://xsibdp.managebac.com/student/ib/activity/cas/21969201">Creating and Following an Exercise Routine</a></h3>
        <p>Since the pandemic, I found myself not exercising and playing sports as often outside of PE classes or other school activities. In this CAS experience, I aim to change this by first creating an exercise routine that is feasible, then implementing or following this routine everyday. At the end of this CAS experience, I aim not only to improve my overall physical health, but also to make exercise a habit in order to stay in shape going forward. I aim to grow or improve physically as a person, learn to take initiative and plan exercise, and adhere or commit to my plans and routines by practicing perseverance.</p>
        <p>The routine will be a simple list of exercises to do in chronological order. From my experience in the PE classes last year I believe that I am sufficiently aware of what is optimal for my current fitness level. Should I need to consult for this routine I can always try to contact my PE teacher last year.</p>
        <h3>Part 2: <a href="https://xsibdp.managebac.com/student/ib/activity/cas/22759592">Building on My Exercise Routine</a></h3>
        <p>As a follow-up to my 'Creating and Following an Exercise Routine' CAS experience, I aim to build on my exercise routine, possibly including weights or resistance bands in my already existing exercise routine. At the end of this CAS experience, I will hopefully be able to become stronger in target muscle groups. I aim to grow or improve physically as a person, learn to take initiative and exercise, and adhere or commit to my plans and routines by practicing perseverance.</p>
        <p>Similar to my original routine, the new routine will be a simple list of exercises in chronological order. In this experience, however, I will include exercises involving weights and resistance bands, which I learned in my PE classes last year. From my experience in the PE classes last year, I am sufficiently aware of what is optimal for my current fitness level. Should I need to consult for this routine I can always try to contact my PE teacher from last year. This CAS experience will be accomplished over the course of the summer break.</p>
